        content: 'Michael is one of the most irreplaceable developers I’ve had the pleasure of working with in my 6 years in eCommerce. Having scaled a Shopify agency from a team of 6 to 24 and revenues from $400k to $1.2m I know firsthand how HARD it is to find the right people to power that growth and success. Michael is honest, skilled, and affable; he is a strong critical problem solver and a gifted technical developer. He is reliable and he is fair...and even with all these qualities (that I’ve found are hard to find in a single developer!) he’s neither a prima donna nor a drama queen.',
