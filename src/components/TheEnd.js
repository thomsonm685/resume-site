                That's all folks. I'm currently juggling freelance work, a steady contract position, and large amount of 
                app development for personal projects on the side. I'm always open to hearing about new positions, very open
                to hearing about ventures, and absolutley love hearing about anything surrounding app development. Feel free 
                to reach out, I enjoy a good conversation.
